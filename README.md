### **Objective**  
To analyze and understand the financial dataset, explore patterns and relationships among variables, address data quality issues, and develop a simple linear regression model for predictive analysis.



### **Key Activities**  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Eliminated white spaces in the dataset.  
   - Converted data types to their appropriate formats.  
   - Identified and addressed null values by filling them suitably.  
   - Analyzed data distributions using histograms, boxplots, and KDE plots.  
   - Examined trends and relationships between variables.  
   - Created a correlation matrix to identify the strength of relationships among variables.  
   - Detected and analyzed potential outliers.

2. **Predictive Modelling:**  
   - Selected the target variable for the regression model.  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.  
   - Trained a simple linear regression model on the training dataset.  
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).  
   - Visualized the regression line and compared actual vs. predicted values.



### **Dataset**  
The dataset contains the following key columns:  
- Segment, Country, Product, Discount Band, Units Sold, Manufacturing Price, Sale Price, Gross Sales, Discounts, Sales, COGS, Profit, Date, Month Number, Month Name, Year.


### **Analysis**  
1. Gained insights into data distribution and relationships through statistical and graphical methods.  
2. Established the impact of independent variables (e.g., Sales, COGS) on the dependent variable (Profit).  
3. Successfully implemented a simple linear regression model to predict Profit, evaluated its accuracy, and visualized key results for better interpretation.
